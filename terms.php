                    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to Madol Press. By placing an order with us, you agree to the following terms and
                        conditions.</p>

                    <h3>1. Nature of Services</h3>
                    <p>Madol Press specializes in <strong>custom printing services</strong>. We produce Magazines,
                        Newspapers, Brochures, Logos, and other branded materials specifically tailored to each client's
                        requirements. We do <strong>not</strong> sell pre-made or off-the-shelf products.</p>

                    <h3>2. Strict No-Refund Policy</h3>
                    <p>Due to the custom nature of our products, <strong>all sales are final</strong>. Once an order has
                        been approved and moved to production, we incur costs for materials, labor, and machine time
                        that cannot be recovered.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> We do not offer refunds on any printed materials once the
                            printing process has begun.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Returns:</strong> Custom items cannot be returned as they cannot be resold.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3. Order Cancellation</h3>
                    <p>Orders may only be cancelled <strong>before</strong> the final proof approval. Once you have
                        approved the design/proof and production has started, the order cannot be cancelled or refunded.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. File Submission</h3>
                    <p>The client is responsible for submitting high-resolution files suitable for printing. Madol Press
                        is not responsible for poor print quality resulting from low-resolution or poor-quality files
                        provided by the client.</p>
